  <h1>Amici: Mapping Roman Social Networks in the Age of Caesar</h1>
  <p>The life of Julius Caesar, the dictator of Rome, is one of the most well-researched eras in history. Unlike most eras in ancient history this period has many surviving primary sources and abundant testimony from later ancient authors working from lost sources. Therefore, this period of history is condusive to in depth methods of research like social netowrk mapping.</p>
  <p>This site hosts visualizations of Roman social networks based on descriptions from ancient authors and research by modern scholars. At the moment, you can find visualizations and analysis based on the Plutarch's <em>Parallel Lives</em>. This analysis includes the lives of Brutus, Caesar, Cato the Younger, Cicero, Crassus, Lucullus, Mark Antony, and Pompey.</p>
  <p>You can also find the nodes and edges as well as the Gephi files on my githib repository. The vizualizations on this site are made using Gephi and exported with Sigma.JS.</p>
  <p><a href="plutarchNet">Plutarch Vizualization</a>. This network includes Plutarch's lives covering the period after the death of Sulla.</p>
  <p><a href="dioNet">Visualization based on Dio books 36-47</a>. These books cover from Pompey's wars in the East to the Battle of Philippi.</p>
  <p><a href="lateRepNetwork">The Late Republic Network</a>. This is a work-in-progress that includes links from all the other networks on the site and the recipients of Cicero's letters.</p>
