    <h1>Amici: Mapping Roman Social Networks in the Age of Caesar</h1>
    <h2>Brendan McCarthy<br />

    <p class="synopsis">Scholars have been studing Roman social life and personal connections for centuries, this site adds to those studies by using social network analysis to quantify the connections between Romans.</p>
    <hr />
    <p>The life of Julius Caesar, the dictator of Rome, is one of the most well-researched eras in history. Unlike most eras in ancient history this period has many surviving primary sources and abundant testimony from later ancient authors working from lost sources. Therefore, this period of history is condusive to in depth methods of research like social netowrk mapping.</p>
    <p>This site hosts visualizations of Roman social networks based on descriptions from ancient authors and research by modern scholars. At the moment, you can find visualizations and analysis based on the Plutarch's <em>Parallel Lives</em>. This analysis includes the lives of Brutus, Caesar, Cato the Younger, Cicero, Crassus, Mark Antony, and Pompey.</p>
    <p>You can also find the nodes and edges as well as the Gephi files on my githib repository. The vizualizations on this site are made using Gephi and exported with Sigma.JS.</p>
