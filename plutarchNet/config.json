Size is determined by the number of connections an individual has. This network demonstrates Plutarch\u0027s focus on foreign wars and eastern leaders like Mithridates and Cleopatra. It also reveals his interest in Octavian.\nThis network has 530 nodes and 1190 edges. The most important nodes in this network are Antony (degree=127), Pompey (109), Caesar (107), Cicero (95), Cato (74), Brutus (62), Octavian (61), Crassus (44), Lucullus (44), and Cleopatra (36).\nThis is a highly connected network with an average path length of 3.125 and an average clustering coefficient of 66%.",
